# INET 4031 Add User Script (Python)
  
**Python Script for Adding Users/Groups to a System**
  
## Description
  
This Python Script reads user/group data from an input file, processes the file line-by-line and adds each user to the system.

*Students should add more to this section to describe the key components of the code.  Why are the imports necessary, what does the regex do, what is the purpose of the # in the input file.  Remove this line when done.*
  
## Operation
  
### Input File Specification
  
The input file should have the following format:

*** username:default_password:last_name:first_name:comma_separated_list_of_groups

For example:

jdoe11:mypass:Doe:John:admins, reviewers

The name of the input file is up to the user.  Convention is create-users.input

### Running the Script

*Students should add a detailed description of how to run the code here. Do permissions on the file need to be set?  How you do run the script?  What version of Python?  Anything else you think would help the person who takes over your code.  Remove this line when complete.*
